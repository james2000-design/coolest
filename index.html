    <h1>What Research Paper Sections and Subsections Do You Need?</h1>
    <P>Your paper obviously needs to contain the main sections<b>(Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and maybe Conclusion)</b> <br> you need to make sure that you name them according to the target journal style (have a look at the author guidelines
        if you are unsure what the journal style is). <br> The differences between journals are subtle, but some want you to combine the results and discussion sections, for example, while others don’t want you to have a separate conclusion section. <br>        You also need to check whether the target journal has specific rules on subsections (or no subsections) within these main sections. <br> The introduction section should usually not be subdivided (but some journals do not mind), while the method
        section, for example, always needs to have clear subsections. <br>The method section subheadings should be short and descriptive, but how you subdivide this section depends on the structure you choose to present your work – which can be chronological
        (e.g., Experiment 1, Experiment 2) or follow your main topics (e.g., Visual Experiment, Behavioral Experiment, Questionnaire).

    <h2>How Should You Name Your Sections and Subsections?</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>a look at this article on how to write the method section of a research paper if you need input on what the best structure for your work is.</strong> <br>The method subheadings should only be keywords that tell the reader what information
        is following, not summaries or conclusions. <br> means that “Subject Recruitment” is a good methods section subheading, but “Subjects Were Screened Using Questionnaires” is not. <br> The subheadings for the result section should then follow the
        general structure of your method section, but here you can choose what information you want to put in every subheading.<br> authors keep it simple and just subdivide their result section into experiments or measures like the method section, but
        others use the headings to summarize their findings so that the reader is prepared for the details that follow. You could, for example, simply name your subsections “Anxiety Levels” and “Social Behavior,” if those are the measures you studied
        and explained in the method section. Or, you could provide the reader with a glimpse into the results of the analyses you are going to describe, and instead name these subsections “Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Mutant Mice” and “Normal Social Behaviors
        in Mutant Mice”. <br> While keeping headings short and simple is always a good idea, such mini-summaries can make your result section much clearer and easier to follow. <br> Just make sure that the target journal you want to submit to does not
        have a rule against that.
    </p>
    <h3>Avoid These Common Writing Mistakes </h3>
    <p>
        <mark>If your heading reads like a full sentence, then you can most probably omit the verb or generally rephrase to shorten it.</mark> <br> also means a heading should not contain punctuation except maybe colons or question marks – definitely
        don’t put a period at the end, except when you have reached heading level 4 in the APA formatting style (see above) and the rules say so.<br> Be consistent. Always check your numbering, for example for spaces and periods before and after numbers
        (e.g., 3.2. vs 3.2), because readability depends on such features. <br> also make sure that your headings are consistent in structure and content: Switching between short keyword headings (e.g., “Experiment 2”) and summary headings (e.g., “Mice
        Do not Recognize People”) is confusing and never a good idea. Ideally, subheadings within a section all have a similar structure. <br> your first subsection is called “Mice Do not Recognize People”, then “People Do not Recognize Mice” is a better
        subheader for the next subsection than “Do People Recognize Mice?”, because consistency is more important in a research paper than creativity.

    <h4>How to Write the Methods Section of a Research Paper</h4>
    <p>
        <ins>A common piece of advice for authors preparing their first journal article for publication is to start with the methods section:</ins> <br>just list everything that was done and go from there. While that might seem like a very practical approach
        to a first draft, if you do this without a clear outline and a story in mind, you can easily end up with journal manuscript sections that are not logically related to each other.<br> Since the methods section constitutes the core of your paper,
        no matter when you write it, you need to use it to guide the reader carefully through your story from beginning to end without leaving questions unanswered. <br> Missing or confusing details in this section will likely lead to early rejection
        of your manuscript or unnecessary back-and-forth with the reviewers until eventual publication. <br> Here, you will find some useful tips on how to make your methods section the logical foundation of your research paper.
    </p>
    <h5>Not just a list of experiments and methods</h5>
    <p>
        While your introduction section provides the reader with the necessary background to understand your rationale and research question (and, depending on journal format and your personal preference, might already summarize the results), the methods section
        explains what exactly you did and how you did it.The point of this section is not to list all the boring details just for the sake of completeness.<br> The purpose of the methods sections is to enable the reader to replicate exactly what
        you did, verify or corroborate your results, or maybe find that there are factors you did not consider or that are more relevant than expected. To make this section as easy to read as possible, you must clearly connect it to the information you
        provide in the introduction section before and the results section after, it needs to have a clear structure (chronologically or according to topics), and you need to present your results according to the same structure or topics later in the
        manuscript.
        <br>
        <em>There are also official guidelines and journal instructions to follow and ethical issues to avoid to ensure that your manuscript can quickly reach the publication stage.</em>
    </p>
    <h6>General Methods Structure: What Is Your Story?</h6>
    <p>
        <em>You might have conducted a number of experiments, maybe also a pilot before the main study to determine some specific factors or a follow-up experiment to clarify unclear details later in the process.</em> <br>Throwing all of these into your
        methods section, however, might not help the reader understand how everything is connected and how useful and appropriate your methodological approach is to investigate your specific research question. <br>You therefore need to first come up with
        a clear outline and decide what to report and how to present that to the reader. The first (and very important) decision to make is whether you present your experiments chronologically (e.g., Experiment 1, Experiment 2, Experiment 3…), and guide
        the reader through every step of the process, or if you organize everything according to subtopics (e.g., Behavioral measures, Structural imaging markers, Functional imaging markers…). <br>In both cases, you need to use clear subheaders for the
        different subsections of your methods, and, very importantly, follow the same structure or focus on the same topics/measures in the results section so that the reader can easily follow along (see the two examples below).<i>If you are in doubt which way of
            organizing your experiments is better for your study, just ask yourself the following questions:</i>
    </p>
    <p>The derivative of e<sup>x</sup> is equal to e<sup>x</sup></p>
    <p>The scientific (IUPAC) symbol for <em>Water</em> is H<sub>2</sub>O while that of <i>Hydrogen peroxide is H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub></i></p>
